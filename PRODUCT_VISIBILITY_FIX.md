# Product Visibility Fix - Instructions

## Issue Fixed ✅
The core issue has been resolved! The problem was that mock products were only initialized for a hardcoded `demo-user-id`, but actual users had different IDs like `1751134209911` and `1751134311621`.

## What Was Fixed
1. **Product Initialization**: Modified `initializeMockProductsForAllUsers()` function to initialize mock products for all actual user IDs
2. **Token Validation**: Enhanced AuthContext to automatically validate tokens and logout users with invalid tokens
3. **Error Handling**: Improved API error handling in the Products page

## For Users Experiencing "User not found" Error

If you're still seeing "Welcome, Test User 2!" but getting "User not found" errors, this is because your browser has an old JWT token that references a user that no longer exists in the server's memory.

### Quick Fix:
1. **Clear Browser Data**: 
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Application/Storage tab
   - Clear localStorage for the site
   - Refresh the page

2. **Or Simply Logout and Login Again**:
   - Click logout (if available)
   - Register/login with fresh credentials

### Test Results ✅
- ✅ Products API working: 12 products returned
- ✅ Categories API working: 9 categories returned  
- ✅ Authentication working for new users
- ✅ Mock products properly initialized for all user IDs

## Technical Details
- **Server**: Running on port 12001
- **Products**: 12 mock products across 9 categories
- **Categories**: Audio, Electronics, Furniture, Home & Garden, Kitchen, Outdoor, Photography, Smart Home, Wearables
- **User IDs**: Products now initialized for actual user IDs instead of hardcoded 'demo-user-id'

## Next Steps
The application should now work correctly for all users. The enhanced token validation will automatically handle invalid tokens in the future.
